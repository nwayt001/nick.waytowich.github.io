## About Me
I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist with the US Army Research Laboratory working on human-guided Machine Learning. I am also the lead scientist for the ARL's Human-Guided machine learning branch and lead a team of researchers developing novel algorithms for human-guided AI/ML. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow working under [Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/paul-sajda) at Columbia University in the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing at Columbia University, NY developing novel brain-computer interfaces. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University, studying under [Dean Krusienski](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/dean.krusienski/), developing practical brain-computer interfaces. My research focuses on learning from human feedback using human-in-the-loop machine learning. In addition, my research interests include reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, human-agent teaming, and human-robot collaboration.
